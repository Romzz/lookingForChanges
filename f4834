Import users from a CSV file.
The file to upload must contain the header: UserId
The file should have one player per row and should not contain any spaces according to the following example:

UserID
1234
5678
9876

Where each line represents an ExternalId from your system
Please note that there is a size limit on the file that depends on length of the players User Id. If the file size is exceeded, you will get an error message “Upload failed. The size of the file is too large.” If so, please split the file into several files.
When editing an ongoing offer, you will also have the ability to upload new files where you can choose whether to "Replace Players" or "Add Players" to the current offer.
